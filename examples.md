## Examples

Here are a few examples from projects that have adapted this work.

The [BeeWare Project](https://pybee.org/), a collection of projects used to develop, debug, and launch Python software, was the first to adopt the imposter syndrome disclaimer in their excellent documentation for [first-time contributors](https://pybee.org/contributing/how/first-time/imposter-syndrome/). Their [resource](https://pybee.org/contributing/how/first-time/) covers the disclaimer, how to help, using GitHub, setting up the environment, common questions, and other first-timer friendly resources. Definitely check it out if you're developing your own guide!

Netflix's Cloud Security team released Diffy: a differencing engine for digital forensics in the cloud, in July 2018. [Announcement on their tech blog](https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/netflix-sirt-releases-diffy-a-differencing-engine-for-digital-forensics-in-the-cloud-37b71abd2698) They're using this Imposter Syndrome Disclaimer in their [Contributing Guide](https://diffy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

[Cyrus IMAP](https://www.cyrusimap.org/index.html), an email, contacts and calendar server, was another early adopter of this work. Take a look at [their version](https://www.cyrusimap.org/contribute.html). Their [Contributor Guide](https://www.cyrusimap.org/imap/developer.html#imap-developer) is comprehensive.

[MetPy](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy), a Python Package for Meteorological Data, uses it [here](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy#contributing). Take a look at their [contributing documentation](https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The [yt project](https://github.com/yt-project/yt), a toolkit for analysis and visualization of volumetric data, uses it [here](https://github.com/yt-project/yt#contributing). Take a look at their terrific [contributing documentation](https://github.com/yt-project/yt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst).

[Lintworm](https://github.com/jlabusch/lintworm) uses it [here](https://github.com/jlabusch/lintworm#how-to-contribute).
